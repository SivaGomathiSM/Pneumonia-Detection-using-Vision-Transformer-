# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Vision-Transformer-
Built a deep learning model using PyTorch and ViT to classify Chest X-ray images as Normal or Pneumonia. Applied data augmentation, RAdam optimization, and deployed the model via Streamlit for real-time prediction. Validated model performance on test data with 94% accuracy, demonstrating high precision, recall, and F1-score.
